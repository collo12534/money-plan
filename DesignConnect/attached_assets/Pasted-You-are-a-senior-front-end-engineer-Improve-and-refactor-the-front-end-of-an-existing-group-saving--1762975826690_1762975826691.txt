You are a senior front-end engineer. Improve and refactor the front end of an existing group-saving web app while preserving every current feature and data flow. Produce clean, accessible, responsive, and maintainable HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) by default. If the repo already uses a framework, give a separate branch suggestion implementing the same UI/UX in React (functional components + hooks) and provide migration notes. Deliver modular, well-documented code, with comments, clear file structure, and small reusable components.

Goals

Keep every existing feature and data intact.

Improve visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, colors, and UX.

Make the UI responsive (mobile-first).

Ensure accessibility (semantic HTML, aria attributes, keyboard navigation, color contrast).

Keep global state predictable and easily testable.

Provide simple mock API contracts so back-end integration is straightforward.

Pages & UI behaviour (must be implemented exactly as described)

Dashboard (home)

Top right: Login/Logout button (changes label and behavior based on auth state).

Key metrics row: Number of active members, Total savings, Pending total, Target and target progress %.

Pending section: a table that lists members who missed the daily deposit with columns: Member name, Missed date(s), Amount missed (sum). Include quick action to send reminder (UI only).

Charts:

Pie chart that shows percentage contribution per member (click slices to highlight member).

Week graph (line or bar) showing total contributions per day for the last 7 days with hover tooltips and Y-axis labels.

Top contributor card: show member name, avatar, total contributed this week, and rank badge.

All dashboard changes must reflect immediately when member/fund actions occur (no page refresh).

Provide a small “activity feed” showing last 10 actions (deposit, withdraw, loan approved, member added).

Members page

Add Member form (inline or modal) with fields: Full name, phone, email, profile image (optional), join date, reason for saving (text/short list), initial contribution.

Member list (searchable + paginated): shows avatar, name, phone, total saved, outstanding (if any), quick actions: Edit, Delete, View Details.

Edit opens a form prefilled; Delete prompts confirm.

Beside the Add Member form, have a compact “Reason of saving” list per member that’s editable (tags or short text).

Provide client-side validation with helpful inline messages.

Funds page

Select a member (dropdown or searchable typeahead) then show deposit/withdraw controls.

Actions:

Deposit: open prompt/modal with fields: amount, note, date (auto today), confirm/cancel buttons.

Withdraw: same pattern with reason.

After confirm, show success toast and update member’s contribution list and dashboard metrics immediately.

Under the deposit/withdraw form, list that member’s contribution history (date, amount, type, note).

All actions are optimistic UI updates with ability to rollback if API returns error (mock behavior in this front-end only task).

Personal Plan page

Section A: Income per week (numeric input).

Section B: Spending categories (editable list): food, transport, internet, electricity, others. Each category: planned weekly amount and actual spent (editable).

Visual indicators: categories with actual > planned show red, near target show orange, below planned show green. Provide simple rules: >120% red, 100–120% orange, <100% green.

Section C: Personal saving submodule (same deposit/withdraw UI and history as Funds but scoped to personal plan).

Bottom: Compact summary card: top 3 categories consuming most of the money (sorted by absolute amount) and a one-sentence insight (e.g., “Food consumes 34% of your weekly spend”).

All values update the dashboard’s personal summary widget.

Loan page

Select member, enter loan amount, click Approve → show confirm/cancel modal → on confirm show success toast and create loan record.

Loan records: list with outstanding principal, interest rate, created date, status (active/paid/overdue).

Repay flow: choose loan, enter amount, confirm/cancel modal, on confirm reduce outstanding and update dashboard.

Interest: computed based on interest rate set in Settings. Show computed interest and total payable on approval modal.

Reports, Invoices, Notes, FAQs

Reports: exportable transaction summary (UI-only CSV export button) and a printable monthly report preview.

Invoices: list and ability to generate a simple invoice template from a transaction (UI-only).

Notes: free-text area with autosave (localStorage) per admin.

FAQs: editable list for admin to modify from Settings.

Settings (admin)

Admin management: create/edit/delete admin (name, email, phone, profile pic, password). Protect password fields; allow password reset UI only (no backend).

Financial rules:

Set target amount and period (e.g., KES 50,000 in 6 months).

Set daily minimum saving amount.

Set global interest rate for loans (percentage).

Security: allow toggling password requirement for sensitive actions (approve loan, delete member).

Provide import/export of configuration JSON and a “Reset to defaults” option (with confirm).

Data model & sample JSON (front-end mock schemas)

Member

{
  "id": "m_01",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone": "+2547xxxxxxx",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "avatarUrl": null,
  "joinedAt": "2025-11-01",
  "reason": "School fees",
  "totalSaved": 12300,
  "outstanding": 500
}


Transaction

{
  "id": "t_01",
  "memberId": "m_01",
  "type": "deposit", // deposit | withdraw | loan_disbursement | loan_repayment
  "amount": 2000,
  "date": "2025-11-10",
  "note": "daily save",
  "createdBy": "admin_01"
}


Loan

{
  "id": "L_01",
  "memberId": "m_01",
  "principal": 10000,
  "interestRate": 5, // percent
  "outstanding": 10500, // principal + interest - repayments
  "status": "active"
}


Settings

{
  "targetAmount": 50000,
  "targetPeriodMonths": 6,
  "dailyMinimum": 50,
  "globalInterestRate": 5,
  "admins": [{ "id":"admin_01", "name":"Admin Name", "email":"a@e.com" }]
}


State management & architecture

Provide a small state layer: single AppState object and helper functions for updates. For vanilla JS use a simple Pub/Sub or EventTarget to broadcast changes. For React provide a context + reducer example.

Keep UI components small and pure. Each modal and chart is its own module/file.

Charts: use Chart.js or lightweight library; provide an interface adapter so the library can be swapped.

UX details & micro-interactions

Use modals for confirm/cancel flows with clear primary and secondary actions.

Provide inline validation and accessible error messages.

Use toasts for success/error confirmations.

Keyboard shortcuts: Esc closes modal; Enter confirms a focused confirm button.

Loading skeletons for sections that fetch data.

Design system (tokens)

Typography: Primary: Inter or system-ui; sizes: 20px (h1), 16px (body).

Spacing: 4px base, use multiples for padding/margins.

Color tokens (example palette):

Primary: #0b5fff

Success: #1f8a3d

Warning: #ff9a00

Danger: #ef3b2d

Neutral: #f7f8fa, #e6e9ee

Provide light and dark friendly contrasts and ensure AA color contrast.

Accessibility checklist

Semantic HTML (buttons, forms, labels).

aria-live for toasts.

Skip-to-content link.

All interactive controls reachable by keyboard.

Images have alt text; avatars fall back to initials.

Testing & QA (front-end)

Unit tests: UI helpers and reducers (explain jest-like tests).

Manual tests: add/edit/delete member, deposit/withdraw flows, loan approve/repay, personal plan stress cases, responsive breakpoints.

Edge cases: negative amounts denied, large numbers handled, duplicate member emails validated.

Acceptance criteria (must pass)

All listed pages implemented and visually consistent.

Dashboard updates immediately after any fund/member/loan action.

Confirm/cancel modals for destructive actions.

Chart visualizations show correct aggregated values for last 7 days and per-member contributions.

Export CSV from reports works for current filtered view.

Settings persist (localStorage) and can be exported/imported as JSON.

All forms validate and show friendly messages.

Deliverables

Clean file structure and README with Quick Start (local static server).

Vanilla JS implementation (primary).

Optional branch notes + snippets for React migration (secondary).

Demo dataset and scripts to seed localStorage for testing.

CSS variables for colors and spacing.

Minimal chart config and mock API adapter.

Please implement with progressive enhancement in mind. If anything in the repo suggests an alternate approach (existing React code, CSS framework), place the new implementation in a separate folder frontend-refactor and include migration notes.
